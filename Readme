Download the python notebook in your preferred editor
Run the code 
Input the start node and goal node in the format shown in the python notebook


Note:
1.Since my code has 3 for loops making the time complexity (n**3), it has a delay in computing goal node. Hence i have used a closer goal node
Each node is stores as a tuple (cost to come, parent, (i,j), index)
